# Planes

This was built on GODOT ENGINE and I am not sure if this contains everything. I found these files through a backup after 3 years.

I had this game idea when I was 8 years old and naturally, when I made my first game, it had to be this. It uses some trignometric calculations to change directions and shoot down the other player.
